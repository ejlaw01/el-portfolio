        <p>I am a 25-year-old aspiring developer who lives in Portland, OR.<br><br>Except on Tuesday nights, when I'm a human Druid with a pygmy owl as his companion.<br><br>Tuesday night is D&D night.<br><br>But on 4/5 weeknights you can usually find me at home watching Adventure Time with my person, a.k.a. Tay Poke, a.k.a. my inspiration and the reason I'm now here at Epicodus.<br><br>And on the weekends you'll likely either find me revelling in the glory that is the Oregon coast, or dancing to some dirty dirty beats in inner SE.<br><br>And all day, every day, you'll see me guzzling mate.  That's MAH-tay, the South American herbal infusion you're equally wierded out by and curious to try, not mah-TAY, a.k.a. Tater Tot, a.k.a. my soulmate.<br><br>But seriously, if I haven't tried to make you share a gourd with me, we're not friends yet.</p>
